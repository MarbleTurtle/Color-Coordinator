# Smart Chat Input Color
Recolors the text in the chat input to reflect which channel the message will be sent to.

Download the plugin through the plugin hub and activate it to use it. Set up colours in the in-game settings or the RuneLite chat colours plugin.

Compatible with Slash Swapper. There is a configuration option in this plugin that toggles whether to follow the buggy behaviour of Slash Swapper, where messages starting with "///" will go to friends chat instead of guest clan chat.
